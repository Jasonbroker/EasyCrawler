 1. Type in the root url or it's links which contains the email info mation.
 2. The url is 2 types: normal type and indexing. normal one is normal as it is. The indexing url is like `http://abc.com/web?studentpage=1`. The number `1` could be replaced by other number and then we can see the other pages there. the max number is always shown on the page.
 3. Crawl speed is the thread number of crawling. Under 100 is safe, while over that value might lead to lagging.
 4.  The inner hyper link will never be fetched so that `strict mode` is very useful for speed up crawling. But if you need to crawl links in the web page, the crawling mode should be closed.
 5. prefix and sufix space and enter is recommonded commonly. This will avoid some common problems which might lead to crawling failure.
 6. The replacement area is the key feature in the software. You can customize keyword to crawl revealed great extention ablity. In some web page `@` is replaced by `[@]`, `[#]`, etc to avoid crawling, but here we can use this feature to replace the `@`. Just type in the keywords even `@` image: `[@],[#],<image='./at.jpeg'>` seperated by comma, all these email types can be recorded well.
 7. Debug mode is for mac, windows can see the debug infomation on the black concle.
